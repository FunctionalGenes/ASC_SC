## Single Cell Data Analysis

This repository contains R code used in single cell data analysis of human dermal fibroblasts and adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells.
The scripts are stored under ```src``` catalogue. ```functions.R``` houses a collection of functions utilized in the analysis, while ```main_script.R``` holds the primary data analysis script
### Description

The R code provided here was utilized in the analysis of single cell data as detailed in the manuscript titled "Identifying differentiation markers between dermal fibroblasts and adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AD-MSCs) in human visceral and subcutaneous tissues using single-cell transcriptomics ".
### Publication

The research conducted in this project has been published in Stem Cell Research & Therapy. The paper is available at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-025-04185-w.
